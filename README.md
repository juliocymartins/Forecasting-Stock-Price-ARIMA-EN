# Apple Stock Price Forecasting with ARIMA
This project aims to predict future stock prices of Apple using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model. It comprises an exploratory analysis phase where historical data is examined, followed by the construction of the ARIMA model for forecasting. The final section evaluates the model's accuracy in predicting Apple's stock prices against actual values. Explore the analysis to gain insights into Apple's stock trends and the efficacy of ARIMA modeling for forecasting.

The methodology employed in this project can be adapted and applied to analyze the performance of other stocks or even cryptocurrencies with minor adjustments.

# Dataset
Data was extracted using the YFinance library.
